A post on the [Gartner blog](http://blogs.gartner.com/tom_austin/2009/10/03/personal-opinion-the-pc-industry-model-is-terribly-broken-will-anyone-step-up-to-the-problem/) gives an insight into why I don’t use a Windows PC (except when I need to do work on customer stuff). I am so glad this isn’t part of my world.

Um, point made.
