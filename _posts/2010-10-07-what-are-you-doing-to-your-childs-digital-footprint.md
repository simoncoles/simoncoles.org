Interesting article on [the digital footprints we are creating for our children](http://jrsmith.blog.avg.com/2010/10/would-you-want-a-digital-footprint-from-birth.html).

From the article:

> - The average age at which a child acquires an online presence courtesy of their parents is at six months, and by the time they are two 81% of children have some kind of ‘digital footprint’.
> - A third (33%) of children have had images posted online from birth
> - A quarter (23%) of children have even had their pre-birth scans uploaded to the Internet by their parents
> - Seven per cent (7%) of babies have even had an email address created for them by their parents
> - More than 70% of mothers said they posted baby and toddler images online to share with friends and family

I wonder if our children will thank us or not? Because that stuff isn’t going to go away….
