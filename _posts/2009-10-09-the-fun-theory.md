Want more people to use the stairs – make it fun! Really like this:

<object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2lXh2n0aPyw&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="340" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2lXh2n0aPyw&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560"></embed></object>

I love the way it takes an every day activity which is generally boring and routine, injects some fun into it, and brightens people’s day (as well as encouraging healthy behaviour).

I wonder what other every day, mundane activities could benefit from some easily-injected fun? I guess parents do this all the time as a coping mechanism… but wouldn’t it be great to do this more in the adult world too?
