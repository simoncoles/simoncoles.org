I’m not sure about the idea itself (at one level seems good but I suspect it’ll have some nasty unpredictable side effects – more detail [here](http://www.fsteurope.com/news/robin-hood-tax/)), but the way the Robin Hood Tax people have promoted their idea is very interesting. With YouTube, do we really need Party Political Broadcasts so much? And it’s great that alternative ideas can get their message across in a visual way as well as the standard blogging etc.

Anyway, here’s the video
