I wonder how many people have now stopped buying physical books because the iPad and eBook store are just around the corner.

I know I have and I am sure I am not alone. Now I just walk through book stores taking photos of interesting books so I can get them on my iPad later.

I’m a bit worried about long term availability but upon reflection how many books do I read more than once? As well as the convenience of being to take stuff on trips, imagine how much shelf space I’ll save at home and work!
