I travel a lot, so roaming is an important thing for me. I’ve been waiting for Orange to publish roaming prices but it appears they might not ever. From [this article](http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article7150226.ece) in The Times:

> Operators are legally required to send their customers a text message when they enter a foreign country to warn them of the increased cost of using a mobile phone overseas. The iPad is not designed to receive text messages and some networks have thus disabled roaming to comply with European law.

How frustrating! And of course, whilst I would be happy to get a SIM for the countries I visit often, they aren’t going to sell me one are they…?

This is mildly irritating for me, but it’s going to be infuriating for people who live in Western Europe and travel between countries a lot…
