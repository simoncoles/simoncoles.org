I first saw this at a Usability Conference this year, it has now been updated most amusingly.

First watch the video.

<object height="385" width="640"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/IGQmdoK_ZfY&rel=0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xd0d0d0&hl=en_GB&feature=player_embedded&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/IGQmdoK_ZfY&rel=0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xd0d0d0&hl=en_GB&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640"></embed></object>
