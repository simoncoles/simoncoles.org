As a follow up to the discussion with Josh about old computers, I thought I would try to find them a Green Screen terminal, similar to the ones I used at University. Hook it up to one of the Linux machines we have at home, they can get the original experience. Maybe even let them have that as their computer in their room (a concept we’re very much against, but if they are willing to do everything on the terminal… :-))

So off I go to eBay looking for an old-fashioned terminal.

I can’t find one.

Seems this is such old technology you can’t even get it on eBay.

And now, I feel old….
