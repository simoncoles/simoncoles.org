Yes, I have an iPad and I love it. I also have a Kindle, and love it too – as a reading device it is much better than the iPad which is fine. As people are pointing out, it isn’t a question of “iPad or Kindle”. Get an iPad, and if you finding yourself reading a lot of eBooks then you’ll find a Kindle well worth it.

I’ve only just started to use the Kindle “Clippings” feature, but I am finding it unexpectedly useful for both work-related books and also (surprisingly) some fiction books. I knew I could get my Clippings file onto my Mac but what I didn’t realise (thanks to [this post](http://kindleworld.blogspot.com/2009/12/web-kindle-tool-for-books-purchased.html)) is that there is a web site <http://kindle.amazon.com> where you can see the highlights you have made on your books. Which is pretty cool if you just want to go back and try to remember a particular passage.

They also have a nice feature that the front page ends up being a “Flashcard” where you can review passages you have highlighed. They seem to have thought about in detail too:

> The periodic review of ideas makes it easier to remember them. This works better if you space the reviews over increasing time intervals, a “Spacing Effect” that was first identified by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus. Using Default intervals, you will see a highlight or note again after 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and thereafter annually. Alternatively you can choose a fixed review interval.

As an aside, I’m loving the fact that [GetAbstract](http://www.getabstract.com/) will send summaries direct to my Kindle…
