I find the political process in different countries fascinating. I don’t know enough to comment, but I find the style differences quite amazing (I remember once as a boy listening to a session of the Australian parliament – wow!).

Anyway, quite liked this from Ron Paul who is apparently a fairly free-thinking US politician:

- “Groping people at the airport doesn’t solve our problems”
- “We have accepted the notion that we should be treated like cattle”
