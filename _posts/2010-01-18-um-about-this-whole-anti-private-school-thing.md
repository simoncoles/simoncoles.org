The Telegraph has [an article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7012085/Professions-told-Cut-private-school-recruits.html) about how the “Professions” have been told to cut down on the number of Private school people they take – apparently this is discriminatory against people from State funded schools.

This makes me cross.

Let me get this straight:

- My parents paid tax, and part of this is meant to pay for education
- They decide they want the best for their children
- So they pay for a better education for their children (Mum was a teacher herself- this was an informed decision)
- Their children don’t take up the state-provided place (thus presumably saving the state money)

And because of this, I should be discriminated against!

There’s a whole bunch of people popping out of private schools, who’ve had a better education than that can be provided by the State, and we don’t want to utilise all that human capital – all that potential – for the good of the country – just because their parents paid extra for their education????

If that’s the case, we’re all screwed. Because we’ve created a country where the parents who invest in their child’s future causes their child to be punished, and the parent who pisses away their money is given a helping hand.

I’m really sorry – my parents sacrificed a huge amount to make sure their children got a good education. Apparently that’s something to be apologised for, and I shouldn’t do for my children?

Surely the solution is to figure out what makes Private Schools better, and replicate that in the State sector??

Surely there’s a big hint that parents are more willing to invest in their childrens’ future – if they feel they are getting something back??

Why can’t we all do better, rather than dragging everyone down to a level of mediocrity??

We should judge people on their merits, not on where they came from. Discriminating against applicants just on the basis who paid for their education is just as idiotic as judging them by gender or age.

Ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous.
