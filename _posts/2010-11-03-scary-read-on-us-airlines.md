I have to admit, I really don’t like flying on US Domestic routes – it just isn’t pleasant and got a lot worse after 9/11.

This article on the [Pilot’s Unions and the Airlines](http://philip.greenspun.com/flying/unions-and-airlines) is quite sobering reading. It appears that commercial instability and quite possibly safety hazards are built in to the industry.
