The Christmas experience has been enriched with the discovery of Herman, a homing pigeon who sits on Santa’s sleighdoing all the navigation of the Sleigh – he’s Santa’s GPS, and will fly down to Rudolph and whisper instructions in his ear as needed. Additional responsibilities include liaising with Air Traffic Control.

A little known fact is that Herman lives on Gin &amp; Tonic and all good Children will leave a G&amp;T alongside the Sherry &amp; Mince Pie (for Father Christmas) and Carrot (for Rudolph).

There is currently a lively debate ongoing chez Coles about the existence of Herman and how it all works out. However we believe we have spied him on some of the [NORAD Santa Tracking videos](http://www.noradsanta.org/).

Happy Christmas everyone….
