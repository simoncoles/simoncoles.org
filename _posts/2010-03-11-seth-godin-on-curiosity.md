[‘curiosity’](http://vimeo.com/2873717) from [Nic Askew](http://vimeo.com/soulbiographies) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Worth 5 mins, if you have it.

To my value set, there’s nothing more tragic than a closed mind (although poverty of ambition comes close). As a parent I look at my young boys who are desperately curious about everything, and then I compare that to some of the people I interview as a potential employer and I wonder what goes on in the school system (and indeed corporate life) to extinguish that curiosity or even worse have people hide it because they think it is somehow “wrong”.
