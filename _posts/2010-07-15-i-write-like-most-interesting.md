Found a link to “I write like” on Twitter, which takes an example of something you’ve written and by statistical comparison comes up with name of a famous author who used similar words or style.

I just did it with a recent post from simoncoles.org and one from elnblog.org and they both came up with David Foster Wallace. Never heard of him before but I’ve just Amazon’d and will see what I think!
