Whilst waiting for him to finish his Tea this evening, I was chatting with my eldest Son, Joshua ([in-progress blog](http://josh.coles.to/)). The conversation went like this:

> Josh: “Daddy, what was your first computer”
> 
> Me: “Well, my cousin had a [Vic 20](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_20), and my Dad had an [Osborne 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_1). My first computer was an [SE/30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE/30). I’ve got the SE/30 and Osborne 1 in the loft, shall we get them down and take a look at them when Mummy is away?” (Mummy’s going on a business trip for a week, so I’m looking for exciting Daddy things)
> 
> Josh: (now excited) “Yeeesss. What can they do? Can they play Miniclip games? Can they surf the Internet?”
> 
> Me: “This was before The Internet. You could do word processing, or spreadsheets, or draw things”.
> 
> Josh: “What’s the point in a computer that’s not connected to The Internet?”.

Um, yup.

Out of the mouths of babes etc… The Internet has indeed had a massive impact in the utility of an individual computer, to the extent that it’s almost useless if it isn’t connected.

One day I’ll sit him in front of a green screen terminal, see what he makes of that!
