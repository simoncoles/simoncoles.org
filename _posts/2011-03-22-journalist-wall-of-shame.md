Some of the reporting is awfully sensationalist and fear mongering, playing on people’s fears to get a quick, cheap story.

There’s a good list of some of the worst examples on the [Journalist Wall of Shame](http://jpquake.wikispaces.com/Journalist+Wall+of+Shame). Really quite shocking what’s being said, which is a real shame because it just feeds on people’s misunderstanding of all things Nuclear and will distort the Nuclear debate for years.

In addition, this is a nice example of Crowdsourcing to hold “professional” media to account, and an interesting use of Google Docs to allow multiple collaborators produce and update a single document (see second half of the page).

Update: The guy who started it has [explained his reasons](http://squeeze-box.ca/?p=785) with a link to a [list of good Journalism on the subject](http://jpquake.wikispaces.com/Some+Good+Journalism).
