(I posted this on ELNBlog, but worth posting here)

The iPad starts shipping 28th May (which means the App Store will work for those of us who have iPads already…) to Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the UK, and you can place your order next Monday.

UK pricing from [Apple’s Press Release](http://www.apple.com/uk/pr/library/2010/05/07ipad.html): £429 (inc. VAT) for 16GB, £499 (inc. VAT) for 32GB, £599 (inc. VAT) for 64GB for Wi-Fi models and £529 (inc. VAT) for 16GB, £599 (inc. VAT) for 32GB and £699 (inc. VAT) for 64GB for Wi-Fi + 3G models.

There’s also [rumored Euro pricing here.](http://www.macstories.net/ipad/ipad-european-prices-announced/)
