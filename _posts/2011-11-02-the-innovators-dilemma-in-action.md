Seems Microsoft could have had a decent rival to the iPad, but killed it.

Courier was cancelled because the product didn’t clearly align with the company’s Windows and Office franchises

As a result, Microsoft is in third place in the Tablet space (behind Apple and Android).

Apple re-thought the “personal” computing experience and produced a product so revolutionary that it the implications are still rippling through the rest of the IT ecosystem – and has driven Apple to undreamed of success.

Microsoft did the same thing (ish) but couldn’t bear to release it – that’s the [Innovator’s Dilemma](http://hbr.org/product/innovator-s-dilemma-when-new-technologies-cause-gr/an/5851-HBK-ENG) in a nutshell. Which Apple [appear to have solved](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/10/steve_jobs_solved_the_innovato.html), which is an incredible thing to have fixed, if they truly have done so in a systematic manner.

Here’s the [original article on CNet](http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-20128013-75/the-inside-story-of-how-microsoft-killed-its-courier-tablet/).
