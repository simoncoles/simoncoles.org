For various work reasons, I tend to buy one of each of the viable tablets. I don’t have time to post full reviews of each of them, but people keep asking me. So over the next few weeks I’ll briefly jot some thoughts down on:

- Apple iPad
- Apple iPad Mini
- Google Nexus 7
- BlackBerry PlayBook
- Samsung Galaxy Note
- Kindle Fire HD
- Kindle Touch
- Kindle

I’ll keep these reviews short and just say what I think. Tablet computers can inspire strong feelings and if I wanted to write something that didn’t upset people I’d have to spend days on a proper review – so before anyone gets upset, I’m just offering my opinion. Please feel free to view that as a reflection of me rather than your favourite device…
