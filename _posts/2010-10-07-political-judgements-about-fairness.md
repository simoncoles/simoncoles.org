Interesting segment from Newsnight with [film director Ken Loach and former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Heseltine debating “Fairness”](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9070679.stm).

Over the past few decade the political parties in the UK have almost merged into the centre ground. This segment really shows the difference between left and right – and wherever you are on that spectrum it is good to see the views expressed so clearly.
