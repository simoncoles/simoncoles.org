End of an era… according to [this article in the Jakarta Post](http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/09/20/postlng-arun-what-are-options.html), the Arun LNG plant at Lhokseumawe will cease production in 2014. The article has a good summary of the history of the project and options for the future.

My Dad spent a large part of his career involved in Arun, first based in London doing the planning, and the we lived in Pioneer Camp from 1977 – 1979 when they build Trains 1 – 3, going to the International School and where Mum taught science. We then came back in about 1981 when Dad was Site Manager for Trains 4 &amp; 5, then 6, and then the LPG Project until they came back to the UK in 1988.

Lots of fond memories, it was a wonderful place to grow up full of amazing experiences and travel. It is a shame to hear that things are drawing to a close, and a reminder that fossil fuels don’t last forever!

There’s an excellent group on Facebook for people who attended the International School of Lhokseumawe (ISOL) [here](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2229380710). Really must dig out some of my old photos etc.

Whilst researching for more background I found the following links which might be helpful:
