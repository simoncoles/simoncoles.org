Found an tnteresting presentation on how Chemical Engineering can help solve the very real problems we’re facing – [get it here](http://www.bostonanalytics.com/leading_thoughts_research/how_chemical_engineering_will_drive_the_21st_century.pdf).

Not sure where I found this – probably somewhere in the Twitter stream… apologies for no direct attribution, I’m a bit behind on reading and it’s all just ended up as loads of Windows open in OmniWeb.
