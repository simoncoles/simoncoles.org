Amusing post on the magic gap which seems to form between code that you write on your laptop but doesn’t work when you get it on the server – and the effect is even worse when you wrote the code on public transport.

Post is here: [Atlassian Developer Blog – General Law of Laptop Relativity](http://blogs.atlassian.com/developer/2009/02/general_law_of_laptop_relativi.html)

> The special law of laptop relativity is that if the code was written on public transport, it will be found, from the frame of reference of the work computer that the code ‘could never have worked’.

Traveling is the main time I get to write anything… hah!
