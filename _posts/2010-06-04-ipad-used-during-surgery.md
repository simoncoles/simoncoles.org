From Crunchgear, here’s an example of an [iPad being used in Surgery in Japan](http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/06/02/video-japanese-doctors-use-ipad-during-surgery/). This one of the exciting aspects of the iPad – whilst it is aimed at being a personal device to kind of bring The Internet and other Media to the sofa, that also means it can bring the connected world into all sorts of strange situations. The kitchen, the operating room, the R&amp;D Lab, etc. It might not be ruggedised but a Ziploc bag fixes that just fine….
