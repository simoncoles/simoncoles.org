I have been a Ken Robinson fan every since bumping into [this TED Talk on “Do schools kill creativity”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY&feature=related).

I have to admit to being increasingly concerned about the education system, both as I watch my children go through the process, but also as an employer. I suspect we’re in a situation where everyone knows the system is broken but there’s too many entrenched views and too little proper communication to help us fix it.
