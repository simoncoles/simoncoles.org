This is a really interesting talk from TED on why play is important – just as sleeping, dreaming etc. are.

We play a lot at work, sometimes what you might view as rather “Immature” games, sometimes more seriously with technology or tools. I believe play an important part of keeping the mind flexible and joyful, which makes it a fun place to be, but also has significant benefits for us as a company.

Play definitely has a place in any well run company, every day, every place.
