[This post](http://blog.simplejustice.us/2009/12/27/safety-first-fly-naked.aspx) comes up with the spoof idea that we’ll all need to travel naked in future, and develops the theme nicely explaining how it would work as the best preventative measure ever:

> Think about the people you see on airplanes. Then imagine what they would look like naked. Eeeew. That’s right, fat, old, wrinkled, smelly bodies surrounding you. Not a muscle would flex on board, fearing that they might touch someone’s sagging fleshiness. Every muscle would go limp. Minds would shut down. Aside from the occasional retching, there would be utter silence as people froze in place to avoid any possibility of human contact. You can’t bring down an airplane with your eyes tightly shut.

Very insightful!
