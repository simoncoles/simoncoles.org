A couple of posts by Miles O’Brien on Air France Flight 447 give a really good insight into the realities of flying.

- [First post](http://trueslant.com/milesobrien/2009/06/08/the-coffin-corner-and-a-mesoscale-maw/) on how planes stay up in the air, the narrow window for air speed, and the problems of weather.
- [Second post](http://trueslant.com/milesobrien/2009/06/10/the-paradox-of-simplicity/) on how the Airbus A330 automated systems help/hinder the pilot.
