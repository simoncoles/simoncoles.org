Having an experience is so much more powerful than learning in the abstract; it is one of the insights which makes [the Outlook courses](http://anewoutlook.com/) so powerful. It is also why most of our training at Amphora is in-context – basically you get on a plane with someone who has done it before and spend a few days out of your comfort zone. You may not like it at the time but you will appreciate it afterwards!

Prompted by [this post from John Udell about his experience in the Hospice movement](http://blog.jonudell.net/2010/10/27/an-unforgettable-lesson/), relevant part of which is:

> This not only poignant. It also speaks volumes about effective explanation. For a long time my mantra has been: Show, don’t tell. If I show you a concrete example, that’s better than if I just tell you about an abstract principle. But that still leaves you on the outside looking in. If I can instead get you to experience for yourself what I am trying to explain, you will understand in a deep way and you will never forget.

As an aside, I find it heart warming when Blogs allow “Industry Personalities” like John Udell (who I read fanatically in pre-web days) can show a more personal side. We’re all human, and it is nice that people we might encounter in a broadcast-only context feel free to share a more rounded view of themselves.
