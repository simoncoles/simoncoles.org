So hereâ€™s a thought.

When I got an iPod, I could Rip all my CDs to MP3 and later AAC. So I could easily fill my iPod up with the music I already had, I didnâ€™t need to shell out for a device and a load more content.

When I got an Apple TV, it took everything I already had on iTunes. Apparently using tools like MacTheRipper you can also backup the DVDs you legally own, so you can play them on your Apple TV. Again, I bought the device but I didnâ€™t need to get a load more content.

But with an eBook reader, I canâ€™t really Rip a book can I? If I want to read a book on my iPad or Sony eReader I have to buy it â€“ even if I already have a physical copy. Which kind of sucks.

I wonder if that has slowed the adoption of eBook readers. Of course, the iPad isnâ€™t just an eReader so it shouldnâ€™t matter too much to Apple.

Now, if someone would come up with a scheme where I can trade in my physical books for an eBook copyâ€¦. ðŸ™‚
