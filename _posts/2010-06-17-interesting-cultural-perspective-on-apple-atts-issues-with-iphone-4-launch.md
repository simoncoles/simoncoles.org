[Really interesting post from someone who used to work at AOL](http://seclists.org/interesting-people/2010/Jun/93) appeared on the IP list yesterday.

> So who knows what happened with the AT&amp;T sign-up fiasco. But there’s a cultural difference between these two companies, and just because folks at Apple are able to pull months of all-nighters to ship the new phone, doesn’t mean their technical counterparts at AT&amp;T are equally motivated….. \[snip\] There’s plenty of blame to go around, but differences in culture, motivation, and economics all probably played a factor in how this whole situation came to be

I can just imagine the cultural differences between a motivated Apple worker who is out to change the world again, and an AT&amp;T engineer for whom I suspect this is just another one of many problems to solve dumped on their lap by some faceless bureaucrat.
