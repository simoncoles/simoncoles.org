Or friends at [BudgetSketch](http://www.budgetsketch.com/) have [launched](http://www.prweb.com/releases/free/budgeting/prweb2100764.htm). I’ve never really got into the traditional personal financial planning stuff before (it never really “Fit” with my life) but BudgetSketch is different… and worth a try.

Can’t think of a better time for a personal financial planning service like this, and I can’t think of a better bunch to do it. Well done guys!
