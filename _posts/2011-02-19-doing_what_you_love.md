> “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.
> 
> Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.
> 
> Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.
> 
> And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
> 
> Everything else is secondary”
