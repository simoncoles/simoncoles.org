Interesting idea in this Harvard blog post on [the TSA madness](http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/Vjeiz2-uFtw/the_hidden_risks_of_the_tsa_sc.html).

> Perhaps the solution is to have a little ticker at the bottom of TV news screens that lists the total number of vehicle deaths each day. It is around 100. So after several years and many tens of thousands of deaths reported, the occasional 150 killed in a plane crash would get the lack of emphasis it rightfully deserves.

Personally I think people should get a [really good grounding in statistics in school](http://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_benjamin_s_formula_for_changing_math_education.html), and then every news programme should start with a reminder that things are news because it is unusual, e.g. outside the normâ€¦.
