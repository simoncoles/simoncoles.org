Ahhh, so the “Free Public WiFi” I keep seeing as I travel is in face the result of a bug in Windows XP… I’d always thought it was an attempt to get me to login to a network where they captured all the traffic looking for passwords and credit card numbers.

Brief excerpt from the article [The Story Behind “Free Public WiFi” – It’s Not](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_story_behind_free_public_wifi_-_its_not.php):

> “Everywhere you go, there it is…but it isn’t because the government finally started offering ubiquitous WiFi for public use without you knowing. Instead, it’s a bug in Windows XP that started years ago and has spread computer to computer, like a virus.”

So that explains it – still not going to use it though!
