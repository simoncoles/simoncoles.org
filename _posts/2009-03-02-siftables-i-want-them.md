[This is a TED talk on “Siftables”](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/david_merrill_demos_siftables_the_smart_blocks.html) – little computers the size of building blocks which you can move around and they interact with each other.

Such a simple idea with massive potential. Love it. I want them and I want them now. (and I am sure my kids will go nuts over them).
