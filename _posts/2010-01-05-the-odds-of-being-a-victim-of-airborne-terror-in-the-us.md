Interesting [analysis of the numbers in this post](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/12/odds-of-airborne-terror.html), which ends as follows:

> Therefore, the odds of being on given departure which is the subject of a terrorist incident have been 1 in 10,408,947 over the past decade. By contrast, the odds of being struck by lightning in a given year are about 1 in 500,000. This means that you could board 20 flights per year and still be less likely to be the subject of an attempted terrorist attack than to be struck by lightning.
