I’ve always been frustrated that Weight Watchers only have a Flash-based food tracking App in the UK – for it to really work for me I need an iPad and iPhone version. No real issue with the underlying weight loss programme but the technical implementation is rubbish.

I’ve just bumped into [My Net Diary](http://mynetdiary.com/) which appears to be just want I need – central database, Web App, iPad app, iPhone app. So far it looks pretty impressive… and given Weight Watchers have just changed their points scheme, now is a good time to switch.

As a added bonus it is a lot cheaper than Weight Watchers…!
