<span style="line-height: 18px;">So I tried to upgrade my iPhone and [wasn’t that happy](http://simoncoles.org/2009/10/dear-o2-about-my-iphone/) that O2’s attitude was a flat “Non!”. Now it seems <span style="line-height: 19px;">[O2 have finally relented](http://shop.o2.co.uk/update/upgrade.html) and if we’re good enough customers we can upgrade our iPhones early.</span></span>

Apparently there’s an “[O2 Priority List](http://www.o2blueroom.co.uk/o2prioritylist/)” (is this new?) which I’ve never heard of before. Here’s what it means apparently:

- All customers continually spending over a minimum of £80.00 a month, receive a 6 month early upgrade
- All customers continually spending over a minimum of £50.00 a month, receive a 3 month early upgrade
- All customers continually spending a minimum of £35.00 a month, receive a 1 month early upgrade

I travel a lot and my phone bill is regularly over £100/month thanks to roaming charges, so I assume I’m at the higher level. Not that O2 has mentioned anything to me.

So let’s review.

- I wasn’t a valued customer until there was competition. O2 were happy to hold me captive and screw me for as much as they could.
- Now I have choices for my iPhone carrier, apparently I am a valued customer. Although they haven’t bothered to tell me.
- My contract ends in 3 months – so the “6 month early upgrade” would have been useful when I first tried to get an upgrade but now it’s just insulting.

Thanks O2, I think I’ll wait until January. I already know you don’t value my business and whilst I know the other carriers are probably as bad, at least I’ll have some choices about plans and probably cheaper International Roaming charges.

There’s a real market opportunity here for a carrier that treats customers as customers, not prisoners.
