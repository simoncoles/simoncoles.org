I’m on holiday at the moment, and have been amusing myself with [BrightKite](http://brightkite.com/) which is quite a nice way of sharing your movements around the country/globe. Not sure if I’ll use it all the time when traveling for business, because it’s a bit of a competitive intelligence leak – but it’s lots of fun for personal travel.

I’ve put a couple of Widgets on this site – Lifestream combines my Twitter and BrightKite streams (nifty plugin!) and another shows a map of where I am.

I am continuously impressed by WordPress and the WordPress ecosystem – this was the work of minutes.
