I’m finding Twitter is making the world feel a lot smaller. Because I work with people in different countries most of the time, and travel a lot, it already felt small. But with Twitter I can really see the rhythmn of life around the world.

I’ve just recently discovered two really interesting web sites. The first is [Twistori ](http://twistori.com/#i_love)which shows Tweets mentioning various different emotions. Simple, and quite entrancing.

From that site, I found [WeFeelFine ](http://www.wefeelfine.org/)which is a really funky visualisation of similar data (but weblogs, not Tweets), but you can focus on specific demographics (sex, age range etc.).This is their Mission:

> At its core, We Feel Fine is an artwork authored by everyone. It will grow and change as we grow and change, reflecting what’s on our blogs, what’s in our hearts, what’s in our minds. We hope it makes the world seem a little smaller, and we hope it helps people see beauty in the everyday ups and downs of life.

How lovely.

People are fascinating!
