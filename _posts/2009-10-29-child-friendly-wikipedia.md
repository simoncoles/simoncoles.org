We sometimes use Wikipedia to help the boys with their homework â€“ most recently Josh had to write about India etc. However, weâ€™re always a little nervous about what else they might find.

> This 2008/9 Wikipedia DVD Selection is a free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection from Wikipedia, targeted around the UK National Curriculum and useful for much of the English speaking world

Excellent stuff â€“ the power of open contentâ€¦
