Yes, this sucks. No fun whatever now, and we’ve got a few more days to go it seems.

I read something about the big freeze in 1962/63 – it didn’t thaw until March! Here’s some more info:

- [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_1962–1963_in_the_United_Kingdom)
- [A film on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl4pJwcE7JI)
- [A page on the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/weather/big_freeze.shtml)

Of course, in those days they didn’t have:

- Cars with funky electronics to stop us sliding around so much
- The Internet (imagine how isolated you’d feel now without it?)
- Multi-channel TV to keep us sane
- The Wii, to keep us fit

And now I shall go back to work, counting my lucky stars…
