So Amazon to their credit have embraced the iPad, and [like this poster](http://timberry.bplans.com/2010/05/what-amazon-and-ipad-teach-us-about-strategy.html) I think it is a very smart move on Amazon’s part. They could of shunned a potentially competing device, but instead they have looked at what their real business focus is (selling books) and as a result will grow their market.

Such is the power of focus. I just wish I could get people in our industry to see it…
