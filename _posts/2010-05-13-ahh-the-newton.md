I did my MEng project on the Newton, and it has a really special place in my heart – beautiful development environment too. I can’t believe it was 20 years ago!

Here’s an old Newton ad:  
<object height="385" width="640"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Bh-yed48e0Y&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xd0d0d0&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Bh-yed48e0Y&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xd0d0d0&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640"></embed></object>

Someone has pointed out [the similarities between one of the current iPad ads and the Newton ad above](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/12/apple-gives-a-nod-to-newton-with-new-what-is-ipad-ad/). The most depressing thing for me is that the Newton is still better than the iPad (or anything else) in some areas… oh well. It was a wonderful, if slightly clunky device (by today’s standards).
