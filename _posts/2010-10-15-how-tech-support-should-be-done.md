Brilliant…

[![XKCD On Support](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tech_support.png)](http://xkcd.com/806/)

Most ISP technical support lines are sooo frustrating, I do so wish there was a way to say “Look, I understand all the moving parts here, and I can tell you we are going to waste the next 30 minutes. Can I talk to someone with knowledge rather than a script??”.

This is the main reason we use [Andrews &amp; Arnold](http://aaisp.net/) as our ISP where possible. When you call, you speak to a qualified, helpful, geek. That kind of quality helpline is worth its weight in gold – we take the same approach at [Amphora](http://www.amphora-research.com), where [tech support is done by the developers](http://elnblog.com/2010/07/a-vendors-internal-organization-often-determines-usability/).

(update: it appears A&amp;A [also noticed this cartoon and have adjusted their support policies](http://revk.www.me.uk/2010/10/xkcd806-compliance.html)!)
